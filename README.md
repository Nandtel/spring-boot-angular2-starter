# Spring Boot Angular2 Starter Application
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Nandtel/spring-boot-angular2-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Nandtel/spring-boot-angular2-starter)

The simple starter application on Spring Boot with AngularJS 2. This is my personal base application for Spring Boot + AngularJS 2 projects. I prefer to use gradle as a primary build system and gulp as a build system for front-end. All the interaction with compiling typescript, prefixing css and installing typings are handled by gulp. All the tasks for installing node, npm and gulp were implemented in the gradle for more convient introduction.

## Motivation

My goal is basic, simple and configurated project for easy start with Spring Boor and AngularJS 2.

## Demo
Demo at Heroku: https://springbootangular2.herokuapp.com <br />
Wait a few seconds until the Heroku initializes app. 

## Installation

Necessary to install gulp and typings globally, if you don't have them:

```
npm install -g gulp
npm install -g typing
```

At first, install npm package for the project. I suppose, you have installed node globally, then just enter follow: 

```
npm install
```

But if not â€“ use this command for installing node and npm locally in project directory:

```
./gradlew npm_install
```

At first build will be downloaded typing, compiled typescript to javascript, concatenated lib.js from all javascript sources, prefixed css and replaced html files. More clearly this tasks you can see in [gulpfile.js](gulpfile.js).

And run the server:

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

Now you can see the result at [localhost](http://localhost:8080/).

## Development mode

For front-end good practice is using gulp watch: when on change typescript, html or css files in webapp directory starts gulp handling task. For this just run:

```
gulp watch
```

Or you can each time start handling by yourself, using default gulp command:

```
gulp
```

In this way, all changes in [webapp directory](/src/main/webapp/) will be syncronized with [static directory](/src/main/resources/static/) of Spring Boot.

Then install [livereload extension](http://livereload.com/extensions/) for your browser and start the app with command:

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

Click to the extension and make sure that LiveReload is running on your page.

Now you can work in reactive style with LiveReload for static content and fast reloading for application.
