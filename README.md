# Spring Boot Angular2 Starter Application
The simple starter application on Spring Boot with AngularJS 2. This is my personal base application for Spring Boot + AngularJS 2 projects. I prefer to use gradle as a primary build system and gulp as a build system for front-end. All the interaction with compiling typescript, prefixing css and installing typings are handling by gulp. All the taks for installing node, npm and gulp were implemented in the gradle for more convient introduction.

My goal is basic, simple and configurated project for convient start with Spring Boor and AngularJS 2.
