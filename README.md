# Spring Boot Angular2 Starter Application
Just simple starter application on Spring Boot with AngularJS 2. This is my pesonal base application for Spring Boot + AngularJS 2 projects. I prefer gradle as primary project build tool and gulp for front-end. Some taks for install node, npm and gulp implemented in gradle for more convient introdution. 

My goal is basic, simple and configurated project for convient start with Spring Boor and AngularJS 2.
